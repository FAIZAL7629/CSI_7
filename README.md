## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faizal7629/iris-streamlit-app.git
cd iris-streamlit-app
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This creates `iris_model.pkl`.

### 4. Launch the Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501/`.

## 🖼️ Example Input

| Feature      | Value |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Sepal Length | 5.1   |
| Sepal Width  | 3.5   |
| Petal Length | 1.4   |
| Petal Width  | 0.2   |

**Prediction:** `Setosa`
